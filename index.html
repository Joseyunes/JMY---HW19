                <p>To get to the moon, first you need to escape Earth's gravity by traveling fast enough in a rocket (25,000 miles per hour, to be specific). Once you're orbiting Earth, it's time to fire the thrusters to change your trajectory and head to the moon.</p>

                <p>I took her out, it was a Friday night
                    I wore cologne to get the feeling right
                    We started making out and she took off my pants
                    But then I turned on the TV
                    And that's about the time she walked away from me
                    Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
                    And are still more amused by TV shows
